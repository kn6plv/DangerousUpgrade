# DangerousUpgrade

Installing this package on an AREDN node running firmware 3.22.12.0 will disable all the
safety checks when loading new firmware. This is necessary to upgrade some node which
are not ... strictly speaking ... compatible, but will upgrade fine just the same.

Use with care ... obviously.
